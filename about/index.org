#+title: About
#+filetags: about

My name is Ayush Kanodia. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science and MA student in Economics at Stanford University, currently in my fifth year. I mix Machine Learning and Economics. I am lucky to be advised by [[https://athey.people.stanford.edu/][Susan Athey]].

* Research Interests

I work at the intersection of Economics and Machine Learning, using methods
from each into the other. My focus areas are machine learning applied
to economic structural modeling and causal inference (and vice versa), and recommendation systems.
Additionally, I like to learn about/use Deep Learning
methods, Reinforcement Learning and Language Processing methods towards these
goals.
