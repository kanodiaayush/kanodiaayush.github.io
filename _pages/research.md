## Research Interests
I work at the intersection of Economics and Machine Learning, using methods from each into the other, which I became interested in during my PhD. My focus areas are machine learning applied to economic structural modeling and causal inference (and vice versa), and recommendation systems. Additionally, I like to learn about/use Deep Learning methods, Reinforcement Learning and Language Processing methods towards these goals. During my PhD, I also did research at IIM Calcutta where I worked on applying Machine Learning to Macroeconomics and Finance, building NLP based estimators for inflation and corporate financial distress. Prior to this, I did research in Databases and Information Retrieval at IIT Bombay, which I became interested in again after Large Language Models became popular, and I started working on LLM based information retrieval and recommendations. I've also worked in combinatorial game theory and auction theory at IST Austria, and in cryptography at Microsoft Research Redmond.
