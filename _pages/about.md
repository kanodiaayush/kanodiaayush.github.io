I cofounded and am working on a stealth startup building an AI augmented knowledge consumption experience. I'm focused on new business models that emerge from building compelling product experiences using AI and large recommendation systems.

Prior to this, I was Co-Founder and CTO at MoveUp AI (Jan 2024 - Dec 2024), where I conceptualized and built career development agents.

I'm a recent PhD graduate in Computer Science and MA graduate in Economics from Stanford University. I mix Machine Learning and Economics. During my PhD, I was lucky to be advised by [Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/), and to be co advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). For more information about my research and a list of my publications, please visit the [Research](/research/) page.
