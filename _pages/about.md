My name is Ayush Kanodia. I'm a senior PhD candidate in Computer Science and MA candidate in Economics at Stanford University, currently in my fifth year. I mix Machine Learning and Economics. I am lucky to be advised by [Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/), and to be co advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/).

## Research Interests

I work at the intersection of Economics and Machine Learning, using methods from each into the other. My focus areas are machine learning applied to economic structural modeling and causal inference (and vice versa), and recommendation systems. Additionally, I like to learn about/use Deep Learning methods, Reinforcement Learning and Language Processing methods towards these goals.
