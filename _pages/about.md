I think of myself as an engineer, scientist and economist (maybe in that order; engineer took first place from scientist thanks to the Large Language Models revolution).

## Interests

1. Coffee - both nice espressos and pour overs.I go from beverage to beverage everyday. I also really like Darjeeling Tea, and more recently Matcha Tea (although not quite as much) and Non Alcoholic Beer (Athletic Brewing is so good!)
2. Music - Indian Classical Fused with (Classic) Rock is my favorite genre. I play the keyboard and sing a little. One day I hope to play the Electric Guitar, especially over Indian Classical music. Here are two playlists I like (there is some overlap between them)
  - [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Z8j28kqLcXFRrVYml1XcK?si=12afe20820f04e93)
  - [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcCa4KMMSjL3fzfeljQ41k0CW0oJmOihH&si=CAMRguxYmHTyP7Nf)
3. Squash - I play squash regularly and also like tennis/badminton/table tennis
4. Watching Sports - I watch a lot of sports, (test match) cricket, tennis, squash, F1 are probably top of the list.
5. Efficient Cooking - I like to say that if you want to be a good cook, you should do a PhD in the US (as an international student). You won't have too much money and only some time, so you end up being efficient.
6. Reading - non fiction books/blogs/articles; my favourite topics are technology, history, economics, business and startups.
