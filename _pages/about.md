I think of myself as an engineer, scientist and economist (maybe in that order; engineer took first place from scientist thanks to the large language models revolution).

I work at the intersection of Economics and Machine Learning, using methods from each into the other, which I became interested in during my PhD at Stanford University where I earned a PhD in Computer Science and MA in Economics. My focus areas are machine learning applied to economic structural modeling and causal inference (and vice versa), and recommendation systems. 

Additionally, I like to learn about/use Deep Learning methods, Reinforcement Learning and Language Processing methods towards these goals. During my PhD, I also did research at IIM Calcutta where I worked on applying Machine Learning to Macroeconomics and Finance, building NLP based estimators for inflation and corporate financial distress. 

Prior to this, I did research in Databases and Information Retrieval at IIT Bombay, which I became interested in again after Large Language Models became popular, and I started working on LLM based information retrieval and recommendations. I've also worked in combinatorial game theory and auction theory at IST Austria, and in cryptography at Microsoft Research Redmond.

I completed my B Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay.

## Interests

**Personal Interests:**

1. **Coffee** - both nice espressos and pour overs. I go from beverage to beverage everyday. I also really like Darjeeling Tea, and more recently Matcha Tea (although not quite as much) and Non Alcoholic Beer (Athletic Brewing is so good!)

2. **Music** - Indian Classical Fused with (Classic) Rock is my favorite genre. I play the keyboard and sing a little. One day I hope to play the Electric Guitar, especially over Indian Classical music. Here are two playlists I like:
   - [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Z8j28kqLcXFRrVYml1XcK?si=12afe20820f04e93)
   - [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcCa4KMMSjL3fzfeljQ41k0CW0oJmOihH&si=CAMRguxYmHTyP7Nf)

3. **Squash** - I play squash regularly and also like tennis/badminton/table tennis

4. **Watching Sports** - I watch a lot of sports, (test match) cricket, tennis, squash, F1 are probably top of the list.

5. **Efficient Cooking** - I like to say that if you want to be a good cook, you should do a PhD in the US (as an international student). You won't have too much money and only some time, so you end up being efficient.

6. **Reading** - non fiction books/blogs/articles; my favourite topics are technology, history, economics, business and startups.
