Hello!

I'm Ayush Kanodia, and I cofounded and am working on a stealth startup building an AI augmented knowledge consumption experience. I'm focused on new business models that emerge from building compelling product experiences using AI and large recommendation systems.

Prior to this, I was Co-Founder and CTO at MoveUp AI, where I built career development agents leveraging my background in ML and economics.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science and MA in Economics from Stanford University, where I worked at the intersection of Machine Learning and Economics.

Feel free to explore my [about page](/about/) for more details, check out my [research](/research/), or read my occasional [blog posts](/posts/).
