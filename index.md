## Hello!

My name is Ayush Kanodia. I co-founded and am working on a startup building an AI-augmented knowledge consumption experience. I'm focused on new business models that emerge from building compelling product experiences using AI and large recommendation systems.

During my PhD at Stanford University, I was advised by the awesome [Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/) and co-advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/), working at the intersection of Machine Learning and Economics. I also earned an MA in Economics from Stanford. Before that, I did a B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, India.
