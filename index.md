    <p>My name is Ayush Kanodia. I co-founded and am working on a startup building an AI-augmented knowledge consumption experience. I'm focused on new business models that emerge from building compelling product experiences using AI and large recommendation systems.</p>
    
    <p>During my PhD at Stanford University, I was advised by the awesome <a href="https://athey.people.stanford.edu/">Susan Athey</a> and co-advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/">Emma Brunskill</a>, working at the intersection of Machine Learning and Economics. I also earned an MA in Economics from Stanford. Before that, I completed a B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, India.</p>
